Native PCIe Enclosure Management
--------------------------

Attributes will show up under all devices that support NPEM PCIe extended capabilities. These
attributes allow for the manipulation of LED states in the enclosure. Definition of the bits and
more details can be found in PCIe Base Specification r6.1-1.0 sec 6.28 and sec 7.9.19. Driver is
not registered if NPEM_CAPABLE bit is off.

Description:	Readonly, list of supported patterns which can be visualized by the controller.
		It presents NPEM Capability Register content. Definition of bits can be found in
		PCIe Base Specification r6.1-1.0 sec 7.9.19.2. NPEM_ENABLED and NPEM_RESET bits are
		always off, these are special bits and should not be checked by user.

What:		/sys/bus/pci/devices/<dev>/active_patterns
Date:		September 2023
Contact:	linux-pci@vger.kernel.org, mariusz.tkaczyk@linux.intel.com
Description:	Writable, mask of currently active patterns. It presents NPEM Control register
		content. Definition of bits can be found in PCIe Base Specification
		r6.1-1.0 sec 7.9.19.3. NPEM_ENABLE and NPEM_INITIATE_RESET are always reported as
		off and cannot be set. NPEM_ENABLE is turned on automatically with every request.
		NPEM_INITIATE_RESET is not settable, it means that driver doesn't provide
		possibility to reset controller.

		Pattern definitions should be consistent with content of NPEM Capability register,
		Driver allows to enable bit only if appropriative bit in NPEM Capability register
		is on. Patterns could be mutually exclusive, it depends on controller.

		It may take up to one second for the driver to complete the request.
