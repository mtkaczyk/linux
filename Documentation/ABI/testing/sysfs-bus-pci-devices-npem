Native PCIe Enclosure Management
--------------------------

Attributes will show up under all devices that support NPEM PCIe extended capabilities. These
attributes allow for the manipulation of LED states in the enclosure.  Definitions of particular
bits can be found in PCIe Base Specification r6.0.1-1.0 sec 6.28.

What:		/sys/bus/pci/devices/<dev>/supported_patterns

Contact:	linux-pci@vger.kernel.org, mariusz.tkaczyk@linux.intel.com
Description:	Readonly, list of supported patterns which can be visualized by the controller.
		It is a bit mask, patterns are not directly defined. Note that NPEM special bits
		are hidden.

Contact:	linux-pci@vger.kernel.org, mariusz.tkaczyk@linux.intel.com
Description:	Writable, mask of currently active patterns, NPEM special bits are hidden. Patterns
		could be mutually exclusive, it depends on controller.
