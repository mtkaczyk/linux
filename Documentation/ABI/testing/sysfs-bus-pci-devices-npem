Native PCIe Enclosure Management
--------------------------

Attributes will show up under all devices that support NPEM PCIe extended capabilities. These
attributes allow for the manipulation of LED states in the enclosure. Definition of the bits and
more details can be found in PCIe Base Specification r6.1-1.0 sec 6.28 and sec 7.9.19. Driver is
not registered if NPEM_CAPABLE bit is off.
It is projected to be exclusive manager of NPEM extended capability registers. Concurrent register
updates are not well respected.

Contact:	linux-pci@vger.kernel.org, mariusz.tkaczyk@linux.intel.com
Description:	Readonly, list of supported patterns which can be visualized by the controller.
		It presents NPEM Capability Register content. Definition of bits can be found in
		PCIe Base Specification r6.1-1.0 sec 7.9.19.2. Special NPEM_ENABLED and NPEM_RESET
		are presented as disabled to the user.

What:		/sys/bus/pci/devices/<dev>/active_patterns
Date:		September 2023
Contact:	linux-pci@vger.kernel.org, mariusz.tkaczyk@linux.intel.com
Description:	Writable, mask of currently active patterns. It presents NPEM Control register
		content. Definition of bits can be found in PCIe Base Specification
		r6.1-1.0 sec 7.9.19.3. Special NPEM_ENABLE and NPEM_INITIATE_RESET are presented as
		disabled and cannot be set. Driver adds NPEM_ENABLE to every request.

		Pattern definitions should be consistent with content of NPEM Capability register,
		Driver allows to enable bit only if appropriative bit in NPEM Capability register
		is on. Patterns could be mutually exclusive, it depends on controller.

		It may take up to one second for the driver to complete the request.
