Description:
		NPEM driver LED interface, created for userspace applications, like ledmon.

                NPEM ledclass devices can be recognized by pattern: "<bdf>:enclosure:<indication>",
		where:
		- <bdf> - is a address of physical device with NPEM/_DSM support.
		- ":enclosure:" - const part.
		- <indication> - is a NPEM indication it represents.

		Brightness file represents state of indication (ON/OFF), not a led state.

		For every NPEM LED device only 2 brightness states are allowed: LED_ON (1) or
		LED_OFF (0). There is possibility that conflicting indications might be
		automatically turned off for indications belong to the same hardware device
                (shares same <bdf>).

		The driver supports NPEM and _DSM PCIe SSD Status LED but the indications are
		corresponding and the backend is not presented to user. _DSM has higher priority if
		both available.
